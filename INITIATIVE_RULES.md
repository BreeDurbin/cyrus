# Individual Initiative with Segments (Revised 2E PHB, the 1989 boxed set / revised rules / also green book reprint)


Roll initiative: Each combatant rolls 1d10 (or 1–10). This determines when in the round their turn occurs.

## Segment system:

A round is divided into 10 segments.

A character’s initiative roll determines in which segment they act.

Initiative 1 → segment 1, Initiative 10 → segment 10.

## Multiple attacks per round:

If a fighter has multiple attacks/round (due to high level or weapon type), subsequent attacks are spread into later segments of the same round.

### Multi attacks example:

Fighter has initiative 3, and can attack 2×/round.

First attack → segment 3 (their initiative roll).

Second attack → segment 6 or another segment later in the round, depending on how you divide attacks.

The exact spacing between attacks can be evenly distributed across remaining segments. Use approximate spacing so that high-rate attackers are spread evenly.

## Spell Casting Time in Segments

Each spell has a casting time expressed in segments.

Example: Magic Missile → 1 segment, Fireball → 3 segments.

The caster rolls initiative for the round. Their first action (start of casting) occurs in that segment.

The spell is not complete until the casting time has elapsed.

So if a spell takes 3 segments to cast, it will resolve 3 segments after the caster’s initiative segment.

### Interrupting a Spell

If the caster takes damage while casting, the DM may call for a casting roll or saving throw to maintain concentration.

Some spells are instantaneous (1 segment) and usually can’t be interrupted unless there’s a critical hit.

Longer spells (multi-segment casting) are more vulnerable to interruption.

### Interaction with Multi-Attacks or Other Actions

While the spell is being cast, the caster cannot perform other actions until the casting completes.

Other characters act in their respective segments normally.

### Example:
Example

Wizard casts Fireball (3 segments) with initiative roll 4:

Segment 4 → start casting

Segment 5 → still casting

Segment 6 → still casting

Segment 7 → spell resolves

During segments 5 and 6, the caster is effectively “busy,” and cannot attack or cast other spells.



## TLDR:

You step through segments 1 → 10 in order.

In each segment, all characters with an action in that segment act.

Multi-attacks past the first from the same character will be scheduled evenly across the next 10 segments, rather than all happening in the same segment.

Spell Casting starts on the currently rolled initiative and resolves on segment initiative + casting time. If initiative + casting time > 10 roll over to the next round mod 10s

## Specific optional rules this system uses:

### Individual Initiative (Optional Rule)

This method of determining initiative is the same as that just given earlier, except that each PC, NPC, and monster involved in the fight rolls and then modifies his own initiative roll. This gives combat a more realistic feel, but at the expense of quick play.

To players, it may not seem like too much for each to roll a separate initiative die, but consider the difficulties: Imagine a combat between six player characters (each controlled by a player) and five hirelings and henchmen against 16 hobgoblins and five ogres (all of which must be rolled by the DM).

Furthermore, each die roll must be modified according to each individual's actions. The resulting rolls make every combat round a major calculation.

This method is not recommended for large-scale combats. It is best used with small battles in which characters on the same side have vastly different speeds.

Example: In the third round of combat, the DM decides to use individual initiatives. Each character is involved in his own fight and there aren't too many to deal with. Cut off from retreat by fallen rock, the trolls attack. The DM asks the players their intentions.

Harry: "Hit him with my hammer +4!”

Rupert: “Chop him up.”

Anne (now in serious trouble); “Cast a burning hands spell.”

Each character or monster now rolls 1d10. The rolls and modified results are:

Rath rolls a 2 and is attacking with his hammer (weapon speed 0 instead of 4 due to +4) and is hasted (-—2), so his modified initiative is 0.

Rath’s troll rolls a 1 and is attacking with natural weapons (+6 modifier) for a total of 7 (1 + 6 = 7).

95

Rupert rolls a 2 and has a weapon speed of 7 and is hasted (—2) for a modified initiative of 7 (2 + 7-2 = 7).

Rupert's troll rolls a 5 and modifies this by +6 for an 11 (5 + 6 = 11).

Delsenora is very unlucky and rolls a 9. Since she is casting a spell, she gains no benefit from the haste spell this round. She has a casting time of 1 for a total of 10 (9 + 1 = 10).

The troll fighting Delsenora is very quick and rolls a 1, modified to 7 (1 + 6 = 7.)

The order of attacks is: Rath (initiative 0) strikes with his hammer. Rupert and the two trolls (attacking Rath and Delsenora, all initiative 7) attack immediately after. Rupert hits. The troll attacking Rath misses, but Delsenora is hit. Delsenora’s spell (initiative 10) would normally happen next, but instead it fizzles, her concentration ruined by the blow from the troll. Next, Rupert's troll attacks and misses. Because of the haste spell, Rath and Rupert now attack again (in order of initiative), Rath first, then Rupert.


### Weapon Speed and Initiative (Optional Rule)

Each time a character swings a weapon, he places himself out of position to make his next attack. Swinging a hammer is not as simple as tapping in a nail. A war hammer is heavy. Swing it in one direction and it pulls in that direction. It has to be brought under control and repositioned before it can be swung again. The user must regain his balance and plant his feet firmly. Only after doing all this is he ready for his next attack.

Compare how quickly someone can throw a punch to the amount of time required to swing a chair to get a good idea of what weapon speed factors are about.

Weapon speed factors slow the speed of a character's attack. The higher the weapon speed factor, the heavier, clumsier, or more limited the weapon is. For the most part, weapon speed factors apply to all creatures using manufactured weapons, The speed factor of a weapon is added to the initiative roll of the character to get his modified initiative roll.

Thus, if the DM decides to use weapon speed factors for player characters, they should also be used for giants, orcs, centaurs, and the like. Otherwise the DM isn’t being fair to the players. However, creatures with natural weapons are not affected by weapon speed. Their attacks are natural extensions of their bodies, giving them much faster recovery and reaction times.

Magical Weapon Speeds

Magical weapons are easier to wield in combat than ordinary ones. Maybe the weapon is lighter or better balanced than normal; maybe it just pulls the character into the proper position of its own volition, Whatever the cause, each bonus point conferred by a weapon reduces the speed factor of that weapon by 1. (A sword +3 reduces the weapon speed factor by 3, for example.) When a weapon has two bonuses, the lesser one is used. No weapon can have a speed factor of less than 0.

* This applies only to creatures fighting with natural weapon—claws, bites, etc. Creatures using weaponry use the speed factor of the weapon, regardless of the creature's size. ** Use the initiative modifier listed unless the item description says otherwise.

## Extra Note

The use of two weapons enables the character to make
one additional attack each combat round, with the second
weapon. The character gains only one additional attack each
round, regardless of the number of attacks he may normally
be allowed. Thus, a warrior able to attack 3/2 (once in the
first round and twice in the second) can attack 5/2 (twice in
the first round and three times in the second).
